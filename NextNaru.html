 <h2>"I'm not gonna run away, I never go back on my word! That's my nindo: my ninja way!"</h2>

 <p>Life is full of uncertainties. There awaits pain, challenges, unknown paths, twists and turns. However one shall sail his ship to return to the shore.There are many secret admirers who watch us from distant. A man returns home every evening thinking of the faces waiting for him. A girl feeds a stray dog everyday, not knowing the dog keeps waiting for her every morning. There are people worth loving; places worth visiting and a life worth living. I am one of the billions of people who is breathing, running, questing his destiny, living every moment, like Uzumaki Naruto.</p>

  <h4>Some of the quotes I find worth sharing to the world:</h4>
 <ul type="circle">
    <li>Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain.</li>
    <li>In the Ninja world, those who break the rules are scum. But those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.</li>
    </ul>
